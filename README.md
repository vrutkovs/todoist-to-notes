```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Install the Package

#### Option 1: From Source (Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vrutkovs/todoist-to-notes.git
cd todoist-to-notes
uv sync --dev
```

#### Option 2: Install Directly with UV

```bash
uv tool install todoist-to-notes
```

#### Option 3: Using pip

```bash
pip install todoist-to-notes
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Todoist API Token

1. Go to [Todoist Integrations](https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations)
2. Scroll down to "API token" section
3. Copy your token

### 2. Initialize Configuration

```bash
todoist-to-notes init
```

This creates a `.env` file template. Edit it and add your API token:

```bash
# Edit the .env file
TODOIST_API_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here
```

### 3. Test Your Connection

```bash
todoist-to-notes test
```

### 4. Export Your Tasks

```bash
# Basic export - exports all active tasks to ./obsidian_export/
todoist-to-notes export

# Export to specific directory
todoist-to-notes export -o ~/Documents/MyVault/TodoistImport/

# Include completed tasks
todoist-to-notes export --include-completed

# Export specific project only
todoist-to-notes export --project-name "Work"

# Use Todoist filters
todoist-to-notes export --filter "today | overdue"
```

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Export all tasks once
todoist-to-notes export

# Export with custom options
todoist-to-notes export --filter "today" --include-completed

# Schedule automatic sync every 15 minutes
todoist-to-notes schedule

# Schedule daily sync at 9:00 AM
todoist-to-notes schedule --time "09:00"

# Run sync once and exit
todoist-to-notes schedule --once

## Scheduling Features

### Automatic Sync
The scheduler runs continuously and syncs your tasks at specified intervals:

- **Interval-based**: Sync every N minutes/hours
- **Time-based**: Sync daily at a specific time
- **Live status**: Real-time display of sync status and next run time
- **Graceful shutdown**: Ctrl+C for clean exit

### Use Cases

**Continuous Integration:**
```bash
# Keep Obsidian vault in sync every 15 minutes
todoist-to-notes schedule --interval 15 --output-dir ~/obsidian-vault/todoist/
```

**Daily Planning:**
```bash
# Sync today's tasks every morning at 8:00 AM
todoist-to-notes schedule --time "08:00" --filter "today"
```

**Project Monitoring:**
```bash
# Monitor specific project every 5 minutes
todoist-to-notes schedule --interval 5 --project-name "Important Project"
```

## Note Format

Each exported task becomes a markdown note with:

### YAML Frontmatter

```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```bash
# Required
TODOIST_API_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Optional defaults
EXPORT_OUTPUT_DIR=./obsidian_export
EXPORT_INCLUDE_COMPLETED=false
EXPORT_INCLUDE_COMMENTS=true
EXPORT_CREATE_PROJECT_FOLDERS=true
EXPORT_TAG_PREFIX=todoist
```

### Todoist Filters

You can use any Todoist filter expression with both `export` and `schedule` commands:

- `today` - Today's tasks
- `overdue` - Overdue tasks
- `p1` - Priority 1 tasks
- `@urgent` - Tasks with "urgent" label
- `assigned to: me` - Tasks assigned to you
- `#Work` - Tasks in Work project
- `due: 7 days` - Tasks due in next 7 days
- `created: 1 week` - Tasks created in last week

Combine filters with `&` (AND) and `|` (OR):
- `today | overdue` - Today's or overdue tasks
- `p1 & #Work` - High priority tasks in Work project

### Scheduling with Filters

```bash
# Keep urgent tasks synced every 5 minutes
todoist-to-notes schedule --interval 5 --filter "p1 | overdue"

# Daily sync of today's tasks at 7 AM
todoist-to-notes schedule --time "07:00" --filter "today"
```

## Development

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vrutkovs/todoist-to-notes.git
cd todoist-to-notes
make setup  # Install deps, setup, and pre-commit hooks
make check  # Run tests and quality checks (ruff + pytest)
make build  # Build package
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"API token is required" error:**
- Make sure you've set `TODOIST_API_TOKEN` environment variable
- Or use `--api-token` option directly
- Check that your token is valid at [Todoist Integrations](https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations)

**"Connection failed" error:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API token is correct
- Try running `todoist-to-notes test` to diagnose

**Empty export:**
- Check that you have tasks matching your criteria
- Try without filters first: `todoist-to-notes export`
- Use `--include-completed` if you only have completed tasks

**Permission errors:**
- Make sure you have write permissions to the output directory
- Try a different output directory: `todoist-to-notes export -o ~/Desktop/export/`

**Scheduler not stopping:**
- Use Ctrl+C to gracefully stop the scheduler
- If it doesn't respond, use `kill -TERM <pid>` from another terminal

**Scheduler missing syncs:**
- Check system time and timezone settings
- Ensure the machine doesn't go to sleep during scheduled times
- Use interval-based scheduling for more reliable syncing

### Debug Mode

Run with verbose logging:

```bash
todoist-to-notes -v export
todoist-to-notes -v schedule --interval 1  # Debug scheduling
```
